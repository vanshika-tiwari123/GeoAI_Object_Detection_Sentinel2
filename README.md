# GeoAI Object Detection on Sentinel-2 Images

This project demonstrates object detection on Sentinel-2 satellite image patches
using a pre-trained GeoAI model in Google Colab.

## Dataset
- Name: Sen-2 LULC Dataset
- Source: Mendeley Data
- Classes: Water, Vegetation, Urban/Built-up, Agriculture, Barren Land

## Model
- Pre-trained YOLOv8
- Used only for inference
- No training performed

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Install required libraries
3. Upload Sentinel-2 images
4. Run all cells
